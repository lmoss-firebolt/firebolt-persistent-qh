# Persistent Query History in Firebolt
Query history, a chronological record of past queries executed in Firebolt, serves as a valuable resource for users to review, analyze, and learn from their interactions with the database. Recognizing its significance in troubleshooting, optimizing performance, and understanding historical data access patterns, Firebolt introduces an enhanced Query History Persistence feature.

> Note: currently, this feature is exposed as a beta feature

## Challenges Addressed
Currently, query history in Firebolt is lost on engine restart or after two weeks, limiting users' ability to troubleshoot, optimize, or understand historical query and data access patterns over time. In response to user feedback, we've developed a solution to overcome these limitations.

**New Key Capabilities:**
* Extended Storage Options: Users can now store query history as Parquet files in their specified S3 bucket, providing flexibility in determining the duration of query history persistence. Users delete parquet files, that system wrote, from  S3 bucket when they consider these files as not needed anymore.
* Preventing Data Loss: In contrast to the current scenario where query history is erased during engine restarts or when users stop the engine, S3 query history logs will persist, guaranteeing uninterrupted access to crucial historical data.

We're releasing an alpha release of our persistence query history capability. Dive in, explore the extended data retention, and leverage the advanced query analysis tools. Your valuable feedback is pivotal in refining this feature for its official launch! Join us on this alpha journey to shape the future of Firebolt.

## Setup
As this feature is released as a beta version, activation must be coordinated with Firebolt support.  

### Step 1: Provide the Following Information to Firebolt
Please share the following details with Firebolt Support:

1.  Firebolt Account Names
    Provide all Firebolt account names from which you'd like to persist query history.

2.  S3 Bucket and Folder Path
    Provide the S3 bucket name and folder path where persisted query history Parquet files will be stored.
    If persisting from multiple Firebolt accounts, you have two options:

        Option A:   Use separate S3 buckets for each account.

        Option B:   Use one shared S3 bucket. Firebolt will store separate files for each account, organized using the following structure:
                    s3://<your-bucket>/persisted-query-history/account_id=<firebolt-account-id>/
                    Replace <your-bucket> and <firebolt-account-id> with your actual S3 bucket name and Firebolt account id(s). Firebolt can provide your account ids if not known.     

Next, Firebolt will provide:
1.  A Firebolt-owned AWS IAM role and AWS account. 
    * **Pattern:** `arn:aws:iam::<Firebolt AWS account id>:role/FireboltData_<firebolt-account-id>`

Enable Firebolt to write, list, and read objects in your specified S3 location, apply an IAM policy following this structure:
```{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
   {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS":  [
                "arn:aws:iam::<provided Firebolt AWS account id>:role/FireboltData_<firebolt-account-id>"
                ]
            },
      "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
      "Resource": [ 
        "arn:aws:s3:::<s3-bucket>",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<s3-bucket>/*/account_id=<firebolt-account-id>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
> Note: Make sure you replace `<firebolt-account-id>` and `<s3-bucket>` with your own firebolt account id(s) and s3 bucket.

Upon receipt of this information, we will enable this capability on our end for the specified account.

## Using Persistent Query History
We recommend connecting Firebolt to the query history parquet files stored in S3. You will then be able to analyze your query history using SQL, or connect your preferred BI/reporting tools directly to your query history tables. 

The following steps outline how to create your query history table in Firebolt, and include links to sample DDL code:
1. [Create an external table](/query_history_ddl/create_external_table.sql)
2. [Create a fact table](/query_history_ddl/create_fact_table.sql)
3. [Insert data into fact table](/query_history_ddl/ingestion_options.sql)
4. [(Optional) Configure aggregating indexes on your fact table](/query_history_ddl/aggregating_indexes.sql)

## Example Queries
This repository contains a set of example queries that you can use to analyze your persistent query history table. The following table provides links to each sample query and a brief description of how the query can be used. You can use these queries as the basis for your own Firebolt monitoring solution, or create your own queries based on your specific questions.

| Query Name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [query_pattern_analysis.sql](/example_queries/query_pattern_analysis.sql) | Use this query to understand problematic query patterns through statistical analysis of performance, resource usage, and cost metrics.

Refer to the [Firebolt documentation](https://docs.firebolt.io/sql_reference/information-schema/engine-query-history.html) for a detailed explanation of the columns available in `information_schema.engine_query_history`.
